The widespread combination of steep slopes capped by well-jointed bedrock makes rockfall among the most common landslide types in Utah. Rockfall poses a hazard because falling, rolling, and/or bouncing rocks can cause significant property damage and be life threatening. At least 16 deaths directly attributable to rockfalls have occurred in Utah since 1850. Rockfalls occur where a source of rock exists above a slope steep enough to allow rapid downslope movement of dislodged rocks by falling, rolling, bouncing, and sliding. Rockfall sources include bedrock outcrops or boulders on steep slopes or near the edges of cliffs, bluffs, and terraces. Talus cones and scree-covered slopes are indicators of a high rockfall hazard, but other less obvious areas may also be vulnerable. Most rockfalls originate on slopes steeper than 35 degrees, although rockfall hazards may be found on less-steep slopes. The runout distance for exposed rock can be determined and structures should not be built in the runout zone.&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRockfalls may be triggered by freeze/thaw action, rainfall, changes in groundwater conditions, weathering and erosion of the rock and surrounding material, and root growth. Slope modifications, such as cuts for roads and building pads and clearing slope vegetation for development or from wildfire, can increase or create rockfall hazards, as can construction of non-engineered and poorly constructed rockery walls, which are becoming increasingly common in Utah. Rockfall is the most common landslide type caused by earthquakes. Generally, earthquakes greater than magnitude (M) 4 can trigger rockfalls. In Utah, the 1988 M\u003csub\u003eL\u003c/sub\u003e 5.3 San Rafael Swell and the 1992 M\u003csub\u003eL\u003c/sub\u003e 5.8 St. George earthquakes caused many rockfalls.

Damage from flooding includes inundation of land and property, erosion, deposition of sediment and debris, and the force of the water itself, which can damage property and take lives. Historically, flooding is the most prevalent, costly, and destructive (on an annual basis) hazard in Utah. Debris flows and related sediment flows are fast-moving flow-type landslides composed of a slurry of rock, mud, organic matter, and water that move down drainage-basin channels onto alluvial fans. Debris flows generally initiate on steep slopes or in channels by the addition of water from intense rainfall or rapid snowmelt and often occur after wildland fires. When flows go beyond the mountain front and lose channel confinement, they spread laterally on alluvial fans and deposit the carried debris. In addition to being debris-flow-deposition sites, alluvial fans are favored sites for urban development; therefore, a debris-flow-hazard investigation is necessary when developing on alluvial fans. Debris flows pose a hazard very different from other types of landslides and floods, due to their rapid movement and destructive power as they often occur with little warning. Since 1850, at least 15 people have been killed by debris flows in Utah. In addition to threatening lives, debris flows can damage buildings and infrastructure by debris, erosion, direct impact, and flooding.

Piping, also referred to as tunnel erosion, is the subsurface erosion of soil by groundwater that moves through permeable, non-clay layers in soils and exits at a slope. Fine-grained sand, silt, and clay particles are removed by the subsurface flow of water, creating void space. An exit point at a slope may not always be obvious. Silt and clay carried in water can travel with the subsurface groundwater flow for long distances, enter the regional groundwater regime, and exit as seeps and springs or into streams and rivers. Rapid erosion may occur when susceptible materials are exposed to running water or wind. Monsoonal storms typically bring intense rainfall and high winds. Heavy rain can quickly erode silts and clays. Slope runoff that becomes channelized can form gullies and erode steep banks of streams and rivers.

When concentrated, such as in buildings or other confined spaces, radon can lead to lung cancer and is Utah&rsquo;s leading geologic hazard in terms of fatalities. Over 5630 fatalities resulting from radon gas exposure were documented in Utah between 1973 and 2015, and thousands of fatalities likely occurred before 1973. Radon decays into radioactive particles than can be trapped in the lungs when inhaled. These particles release small bursts of energy that damage lung tissue, leading to lung cancer. Only smoking causes more lung cancer deaths, and smoking, when combined with radon, is a particularly serious health risk. Geologic conditions directly affect indoor radon gas levels; however, indoor radon gas levels are highly dependent on building construction methods.

For example, the Moab-Spanish Valley was formed by the collapse of salt-cored upward flexing rocks (anticline) of the salt-rich Paradox Formation. After the anticline formed, the valley developed due to the dissolution of salt deposits at depth, causing the rock above to collapse or subside downward, forming a valley. The upward movement of salt, due to its low density, plastic nature, and salt dissolution, have resulted in ground deformation, including the development of fractures, folds, joints, grabens, and faults along the edges of the valley. The resulting displacement of the ground surface may also produce ground cracking, surface warping, and multiple, complex scarps (near-vertical slopes). Depending on the magnitude of subsurface movement, scarps can range from a few inches to several feet high and extend for many miles along a fault trace or deformation zone. These zones may be tens to hundreds of feet wide. Surface fault rupture related to gravitational faulting (due to the weight of rocks above the salt) can cause damage like that of tectonic-related (movement of the Earth's tectonic plates) surface fault rupture and can have serious consequences for buildings or other facilities that lie along or across the rupture path.

                "Text": "\u003cp\u003eMany Utah landslides are considered dormant, but recent slope failures are commonly reactivations of pre-existing landslides, suggesting that even so-called dormant landslides may continue to exhibit slow creep or are capable of renewed movement if stability thresholds are exceeded. Past slope failures can be used to identify the geologic, hydrologic, and topographic conditions that may reactivate existing landslides and initiate new landslides. Developing on landslides will always involve a level of irreducible, inherent risk. Landslides often impact more than one parcel or lot and attempting to stabilize a landslide on only one parcel or lot is rarely successful. The map below shows mapped landslides for your area of interest and the boundary of previously mapped areas from the \u003cem\u003eUtah Landslide Database\u003c/em\u003e.
