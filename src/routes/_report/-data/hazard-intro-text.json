                "Text": "<p>In the Intermountain West, earthquakes of M6.5 and larger generally produce surface fault rupture, where the ground on one side of the fault moves upward and the other side moves downward (called a normal fault). These movements of the ground surface along a tectonic fault during an earthquake often produce a steep scarp (slope) or a series of generally parallel scarps.&nbsp; If a fault were to rupture beneath a building or critical structure (tanks, communication towers, electrical substations, etc.) significant structural damage or collapse may occur, possibly causing severe injuries and loss of life.&nbsp; For this reason, the UGS recommends that buildings and structures not be constructed over or directly adjacent to hazardous faults.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The map below shows where hazardous faults have been mapped, along with UGS-designated and recommended special-study zones (shaded map areas) associated with the mapped faults within the area of interest defined for this report. These special-study zones define locations where the UGS recommends comprehensive, site-specific surface-fault-rupture investigations to accurately locate the hazardous fault and determine appropriate building setback distances following UGS guidelines (<a href=\"https://ugspub.nr.utah.gov/publications/circular/c-128.pdf \" target=\"_blank\">https://ugspub.nr.utah.gov/publications/circular/c-128.pdf</a>).&nbsp; Note that developing near hazardous faults will always involve a level of inherent risk.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How to Use This Map</strong></p>\n<p>Your area of interest has surface-fault-rupture special-study zones associated with the faults listed above. This means that the site is in the vicinity of a mapped, hazardous fault or faults.

The UGS recommends a site-specific, surface-fault-rupture hazard investigation be performed prior to development within the special-study zone.&nbsp; Site-specific geotechnical/geologic-hazard investigations can resolve uncertainties inherent in the generalized map scale and help ensure safety by identifying the need for fault setbacks.&nbsp; This map is not intended for use at scales other than 1:24,000. Smaller faults may not have been detected during mapping or are concealed beneath young geologic deposits.&nbsp; Additionally, concealed and approximately located faults lack a clearly identifiable surface trace; therefore, their locations are approximate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>More Information</strong></p>\n<p>Although these areas are not regulated on a state-level, many cities and counties throughout Utah have adopted development ordinances requiring a comprehensive, site-specific surface-fault-rupture investigation.

                "Text": "<p>Rockfall is a natural mass-movement process that involves the dislodging and rapid downslope movement of individual rocks and rock masses. The widespread combination of steep slopes capped by well-jointed bedrock makes rockfall among the most common landslide types in Utah. Rockfall poses a hazard because falling, rolling, and/or bouncing rocks can cause significant property damage and be life threatening. At least 16 deaths directly attributable to rockfalls have occurred in Utah since 1850. Rockfalls occur where a source of rock exists above a slope steep enough to allow rapid downslope movement of dislodged rocks by falling, rolling, bouncing, and sliding. Rockfall sources include bedrock outcrops or boulders on steep slopes or near the edges of cliffs, bluffs, and terraces. Talus cones and scree-covered slopes are indicators of a high rockfall hazard, but other less obvious areas may also be vulnerable. Most rockfalls originate on slopes steeper than 35 degrees, although rockfall hazards may be found on less-steep slopes. The runout distance for exposed rock can be determined and structures should not be built in the runout zone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rockfalls may be triggered by freeze/thaw action, rainfall, changes in groundwater conditions, weathering and erosion of the rock and surrounding material, sun thermal cycling, seismic activity, and root growth. Slope modifications, such as cuts for roads and building pads and clearing slope vegetation for development or from wildfire, can increase or create rockfall hazards, as can construction of non-engineered and poorly constructed rockery walls, which are becoming increasingly common in Utah. Rockfall is the most common landslide type caused by earthquakes. Generally, earthquakes greater than magnitude (M) 4 can trigger rockfalls. In Utah, the 1988 M 5.3 San Rafael Swell and the 1992 M 5.8 St. George earthquakes caused many rockfalls. Although not well documented, rockfalls in Utah appear to occur more frequently during the spring and summer, likely due to spring snowmelt, summer storms, and large daily temperature variations.

Rockfall can become a hazard in areas with no mapped hazard due to modification of slopes for construction, roads, or natural processes.

Damage from flooding includes inundation of land and property, erosion, deposition of sediment and debris, and the force of the water itself, which can damage property and take lives. Historically, flooding is the most prevalent, costly, and destructive (on an annual basis) hazard in Utah. Debris flows and related sediment flows are fast-moving flow-type landslides composed of a slurry of rock, mud, organic matter, and water that move down drainage-basin channels onto alluvial fans. Debris flows generally initiate on steep slopes or in channels by the addition of water from intense rainfall or rapid snowmelt and often occur after wildland fires. When flows go beyond the mountain front and lose channel confinement, they spread laterally on alluvial fans and deposit the carried debris. In addition to being debris-flow-deposition sites, alluvial fans are favored sites for urban development; therefore, a debris-flow-hazard investigation is necessary when developing on alluvial fans. Debris flows pose a hazard very different from other types of landslides and floods, due to their rapid movement and destructive power as they often occur with little warning. Since 1850, at least 15 people have been killed by debris flows in Utah. In addition to threatening lives, debris flows can damage buildings and infrastructure by debris, erosion, direct impact, and flooding.

Over 5729 fatalities resulting from radon gas exposure were documented in Utah between 1973 and 2016, and thousands of fatalities likely occurred before 1973.

Only smoking causes more lung cancer deaths, and smoking, when combined with radon, is a particularly serious health risk. Geologic conditions directly affect indoor radon gas levels; however, indoor radon gas levels are highly dependent on building construction methods.

For example, the Moab-Spanish Valley was formed by the collapse of salt-cored upward flexing rocks (anticline) of the salt-rich Paradox Formation. After the anticline formed, the valley developed due to the dissolution of salt deposits at depth, causing the rock above to collapse or subside downward, forming a valley. The upward movement of salt, due to its low density, plastic nature, and salt dissolution, have resulted in ground deformation, including the development of fractures, folds, joints, grabens, and faults along the edges of the valley. The resulting displacement of the ground surface may also produce ground cracking, surface warping, and multiple, complex scarps (near-vertical slopes). Depending on the magnitude of subsurface movement, scarps can range from a few inches to several feet high and extend for many miles along a fault trace or deformation zone. These zones may be tens to hundreds of feet wide. Surface fault rupture related to gravitational faulting (due to the weight of rocks above the salt) can cause damage like that of tectonic-related (movement of the Earth's tectonic plates) surface fault rupture and can have serious consequences for buildings or other facilities that lie along or across the rupture path.

Soil and rock containing salt, gypsum, and limestone are susceptible to dissolution, which is associated with karst, sinkholes, and subsidence (sinking of the ground). Gypsum- and salt-bearing soil and rock are highly soluble. Changes in surface-water flow and groundwater can quickly dissolve gypsiferous material, resulting in cavities that can collapse, either propagating to the surface or causing local or regional subsidence. Gypsum dissolution can be greatly increased by water application from sources like reservoirs; septic-tank and wastewater drain fields; street, roof, or parking-lot runoff; and landscape irrigation. Extreme care should be taken in areas of gypsiferous materials to avoid surface-flow and groundwater changes. Surface flow should be directed to areas where it will not percolate into the material below. Landscape irrigation is highly discouraged, and storm drain infrastructure should be regularly maintained to prevent leaks and sealed pipes should be considered.
